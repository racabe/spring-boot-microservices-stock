A stock management as a Rest-Microservice

## Description
This project is to develop a stock management as a Rest-Microservice in Java using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka. 

The stock management maintains the current stock amount for a product. The stock can be increased (refill) or decreased (client buys a product). The stock should be maintained on a per-product basis.
